See `AGENTS.md` for the workflow this file follows.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.21] - 2026-09-02

- **Fixed the Archer's drawing-arm shoulder sitting almost on the neck** — verified with real
  coordinates: the back shoulder was landing just 0.5 units below the head/neck boundary when
  facing horizontally, from a shoulder offset (3.5) that was too large. Reduced to 1.8, which
  pulls it to 2.2 units of clearance — over 4x more room — confirmed with the same math before
  shipping, not just eyeballed.

## [1.0.20] - 2026-09-02

- **Armor now draws on top of arms instead of being crossed over by them** — the chest plate
  (level 2+) and helmet (level 3+) were rendered before the arms, so arm lines cut across and
  obscured them. Moved armor rendering to happen after everything else instead.
- **Increased weapon size growth per INT investment** — first attempt at this actually made growth
  *slower* (verified the mistake with real numbers before shipping it, then reverted). The
  correct fix: increased the actual min/max size targets for all 8 classes by roughly 15-30%
  rather than changing the growth curve itself. Confirmed with real numbers that the same amount
  of INT investment now produces a visibly bigger weapon (e.g. Swordsman: 17.5 units old vs. 19.0
  new, at the same realistic investment level) while the zero-INT baseline size didn't shrink.
  Re-verified head clearance against every new max size — Swordsman and Two-Hander needed more
  conservative caps (23/24 instead of an initially-planned 26/30) to stay clear.

## [1.0.19] - 2026-09-02

- **Restored upright weapons when idle/between rounds** — a couple versions ago these were
  switched to hang downward to sidestep a head-clearance issue with the bigger weapon sizes, but
  upright reads better and was the original design intent. Restored the 55°-tilted upright pose
  and re-verified with real numbers (not assumed from before) that every class's current actual
  max size still clears the head at this angle — all 7 confirmed clear, none needed further
  adjustment.

## [1.0.18] - 2026-09-02

- **Fixed the Archer's drawing-arm elbow bending unnaturally upward when facing right (or left)**
  — traced the exact cause: the back shoulder's own offset already sits above center when facing
  horizontally, and the old perpendicular elbow-kick compounded in that same direction, stacking
  the elbow well above the shoulder. Replaced the perpendicular kick with a fixed downward droop,
  matching real archery form (the drawing elbow stays level or drops slightly, never rises).
  Verified with real coordinates for the exact "facing right" case reported — the elbow now sits
  below the shoulder instead of stacked above it, and this holds at every facing direction since
  the droop no longer depends on aim angle at all.

## [1.0.17] - 2026-09-02

- **Fixed the off-hand crossing to the wrong side of the body while swinging** — last version's
  vertical clamp only stopped it from swinging up into the air, but didn't stop the horizontal
  case: when the weapon swings toward the left, its "exact opposite" angle points right, sending
  the off-hand (anchored on the left shoulder) reaching all the way across the body. Confirmed
  this with real angle math before touching code. Rather than patching the direction-tracking
  approach a third time, replaced it entirely — the off-hand is now fixed at its natural resting
  angle regardless of the weapon's swing direction, so there is no longer any possible angle where
  it can cross the body or swing upward, verified by testing it against five different weapon
  angles and confirming the output is now identical every time. Applied to all 6 classes that
  shared the old pattern (Swordsman, Spearman, Mage, Bomber, Gatling, Cleric).

## [1.0.16] - 2026-09-02

- **Fixed the off-hand swinging up into the air while attacking** — it counterbalanced the exact
  opposite of the weapon arm's swing angle, which is correct most of the time but points straight
  up whenever the enemy being fought happens to be above the tower. Clamped so it reflects back
  downward instead, keeping the same left/right lean without ever raising into the air. Verified
  across five different swing scenarios (enemy above, below, left, right, diagonal) — the exact
  "enemy above" case that broke before now stays correctly grounded. Applied to all 6 affected
  classes (Swordsman, Spearman, Mage, Bomber, Gatling, Cleric).
- **Fixed a color mismatch on the Archer** — the nocked arrow shown mid-draw was brown, but the
  actual fired arrow projectile is yellow/gold. Matched them so the same arrow looks consistent
  whether it's being drawn or already in flight.

## [1.0.15] - 2026-09-02

- **Weapons are noticeably bigger at base, and STR now makes them thicker** — added a new
  `weaponThickness` stat (diminishing returns, capped at 1.8x) applied to blade width, crossguard
  size, hilt size, and equivalent head/tip geometry across every weapon-holding class. INT still
  controls length via the existing system, now with meaningfully larger min/max ranges per class
  (e.g. Swordsman went from 9-12.5 to 14-24 units).
- The bigger base sizes meant the old straight-up idle pose no longer had enough vertical
  clearance below the head, so idle weapons across all affected classes now tilt 55° instead of
  pointing straight up — verified with real numbers that every single class's new maximum size
  stays clear of the head at this angle, not just guessed at.

## [1.0.14] - 2026-09-02

- **Fixed arms visually floating away from the torso** — every two-armed class positioned its
  arms starting ±3 to ±4 units to either side of the torso's centerline, with nothing drawn to
  bridge that gap, so arms read as disconnected from the body. Reduced to ±1.5 across all 15
  affected call sites (still enough separation to distinguish left/right, but close enough to
  read as actually attached).
- **Fixed the Archer's drawing-arm elbow flaring the wrong way** — the elbow kick used a fixed
  rotational formula independent of which side the back shoulder actually sits on, so depending
  on which direction the Archer was facing, the elbow could bend toward the body instead of away
  from it. Now kicks in the same direction the back shoulder is already offset, which is
  guaranteed correct regardless of facing — verified across all four cardinal directions, not
  just the one that happened to look right during testing.

## [1.0.13] - 2026-09-02

- **Found and removed the actual root cause of every "extra limb" report across this entire
  session.** There was a leftover global block — drawn unconditionally, for every class except
  Axeman and dual/two-hander Swordsman specs, completely outside the careful per-class off-hand
  systems that were built afterward — that stamped a hardcoded extra arm-like line (0,-12) to
  (-10,-2) on top of everything else, every single frame. Every class already had its own correct
  off-hand logic; this was pure leftover dead code silently drawing a genuine extra limb on top of
  it the whole time. Manually verified (not just scripted) that Swordsman, Mage, and Spearman each
  render exactly the arms they should — no more, no less — with this block gone.

## [1.0.12] - 2026-09-02

- **Fixed weapon size changing when a tower swings/fires** — idle and engaged poses were computing
  weapon length from two entirely different formulas (a short idle-safe base vs. the old full
  combat length), so the weapon visibly grew or shrank depending on whether the tower had a
  target. Replaced with a single shared function (`weaponLenFromScale`) that both states now call
  identically — same length whether idle or mid-swing, only INT/range investment changes it.
- Every weapon-holding class now has an explicit min length (at no INT invested) and max length
  (at that class's own range cap), verified with real numbers: min is hit exactly at baseline,
  max is hit exactly at the range cap, and the value never overshoots even against out-of-range
  inputs. Applied to all 8 classes — Swordsman, Axeman, Spearman, Hammerman, Mage, Bomber,
  Gatling, and Squirt Gun.

## [1.0.11] - 2026-09-02

- **Fixed weapon growth (INT/range investment) being completely invisible when idle** — a
  regression from the head-overlap fix two versions ago. Proved it with real numbers: every
  weaponScale from 1.0x to 1.6x was clamping to the exact same length, meaning INT investment had
  zero visible effect on idle weapon size, for all 7 affected classes (Swordsman, Spearman,
  Hammerman, Mage, Bomber, Gatling, Squirt Gun). The fix: idle poses now use their own shorter
  base length sized to fit entirely within the safe head-clearance budget, so growth is visible
  at every single step across the realistic range, while the clamp remains as a safety net only
  for genuinely extreme edge cases (e.g. a maxed-out Two-Hander).
- **Lowered the shoulder pivot slightly** (y=-15 → y=-13) — the previous "attach arms at the
  body's edge" fix had overcorrected a bit too high.

## [1.0.10] - 2026-09-02

- **Random pool-size variance** — roughly 1 in 5 blood pools now come out dramatically bigger
  (verified: up to 2.6x larger at the extreme, not just marginal noise), with more blobs and a
  wider spread, so the ground doesn't fill up with uniform puddles.
- Pushed overall gore further: more particles in every layer, more gib debris per kill (up to 10
  at high graphics), and a third scattered stain per death for a genuinely messy, uneven pool
  rather than a tidy ring around the kill point.

## [1.0.9] - 2026-09-02

- **Fixed Archer's drawing arm — the real cause of the recurring "extra limb" look.** The string
  arm was using the same generic fixed-segment-ratio arm function as every other class, but that
  function assumes a roughly full-length reach. Pulling it in close (as short as 6 units, early
  in the draw animation) forced the upper arm and forearm into a cramped, overlapping fold that
  read as an extra limb. Replaced with proper geometry for this specific case: the string hand
  slides back from the bow grip along the aim axis exactly like a real draw motion, and the elbow
  kicks out perpendicular to the shoulder-to-hand line so it stays clean at any pull distance.
  Verified with real geometry math across the full draw cycle (0% to 100%) — both arm segments
  stay a sane, non-degenerate length the entire time, no collapse at any point.

## [1.0.8] - 2026-09-02

- **Significantly escalated gore intensity** — main blood burst nearly doubled (22→42 particles),
  added a third bright high-velocity spray layer, and a new tumbling "gib" debris system (chunky
  rotating squares, distinct from the fine spray, with heavier physics). Pooling decals now spawn
  two overlapping stains per death instead of one, each with more and larger splatter blobs.
  Screen shake on kill increased and lasts longer. On-hit spray (not just kills) also boosted, so
  every hit reads as visceral, not just the kill itself.
- Fixed a real bug caught before shipping the above: the particle pool is reused in a circular
  buffer, so a slot previously used for the new gib debris could leak its rotating-square render
  mode into a later, unrelated particle spawn. Every regular particle spawn now explicitly resets
  that flag.

## [1.0.7] - 2026-09-02

- **Extended curated waves from 20 to 100** — rather than hand-typing 80 one-off arrays (slow,
  error-prone, hard to balance consistently), built on the existing procedural-wave formulas and
  added two new archetypes: 🃏 Trick (opens deceptively weak, then springs Splitters/Trolls/Tanks
  mid-wave) and ⛏️ Grind (a long, widely-spaced slog testing sustained DPS and economy rather than
  burst reaction). Waves cycle through 7 archetypes with a dedicated 👑 Boss milestone every 10th
  wave (30, 40, 50...100), all baked into real, concrete wave definitions rather than left to
  run-time randomness.
- Caught and fixed a real overflow bug during generation: the original count-scaling formulas,
  uncapped, would have produced a 698-enemy wave by wave 98 — nearly 3x the enemy pool's actual
  220-object capacity, meaning most of that wave would have silently failed to spawn. Capped the
  scaling input so the worst-case wave (157 enemies) stays safely under the pool limit.
- The wave-type toast (previously only shown for waves beyond the hand-authored range) now also
  fires for these new curated waves, so the Trick/Grind/Boss distinction is visible in-game.

## [1.0.6] - 2026-09-02

- **Fixed idle weapons overshooting past the head** — a regression from raising the shoulder
  pivot two versions ago (to fix arms attaching at the middle of the body): every class's idle
  "weapon held straight up" pose never got re-checked against the new, higher shoulder position,
  so the sword/staff/hammer/etc. tip was crossing up into the head — confirmed with actual
  geometry math, not just a guess (blade tip landed inside the head's circle at every weapon
  scale, even the base case). Added a shared clamp so any idle weapon's upward reach is capped
  just below the head, applied to all 7 affected classes (Swordsman, Spearman, Hammerman, Mage,
  Bomber, Gatling, Squirt Gun) from one shared function.

## [1.0.5] - 2026-09-02

- **Gravity on gore particles** — the blood burst on hit/death now arcs and falls instead of
  spraying out in a flat radial pattern, reading as actual directional spray rather than a
  generic particle puff. Every other particle use (gold pickups, sparkles, star effects) is
  unaffected — gravity is opt-in per spawn.
- **Persistent ground blood decals** — enemy deaths in gore mode now leave a permanent pooling
  stain on the ground (a few overlapping irregular blobs, not a plain circle), capped at 150
  active stains on a circular buffer so it stays performance-safe over a long session. Clears on
  a new game and immediately when gore mode is turned off.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-09-02

- **Extended curated waves from 15 to 20** — 5 new hand-authored waves escalating through the full
  enemy roster (heavier Tank/Zombie/Wraith combinations, denser Swarm/Wolf floods, an Undead
  Uprising, and a Shielded/Splitter gauntlet), ending in a bigger 2-Boss finale at wave 20.
  Procedural generation still takes over seamlessly past that, unchanged.
- **Steeper per-wave HP scaling** — 20% growth per wave instead of 15%, so difficulty ramps up
  meaningfully faster across the whole game, not just in the new waves.
- Confirmed Barricades were already correctly restricted to path tiles only (this had been flagged
  as possibly missing — checked the actual code and it was already implemented correctly).

## [1.0.3] - 2026-09-02

- **Fixed DEX/INT damage bonuses not applying to evolved classes** — the check was against a
  tower's literal type (`'ARCHER'`, `'MAGE'`) rather than its archetype, so Blowdart, Squirt Gun,
  Gatling, Bomber, and Cleric all silently lost their own archetype's primary damage scaling the
  moment they evolved. Now checks archetype, so every class in a family keeps its stat scaling
  through every evolution stage.
- Added an Attack Speed stat (⚡, attacks/second) to the tower inspect panel — previously only
  visible indirectly through cooldown timing, not shown as an actual number anywhere.
- Squirt Gun now renders holding actual pistol emoji (🔫) instead of plain grey line-shapes.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-09-02

- **Fixed arms attaching at the middle of the body instead of the shoulder** — the shared shoulder
  pivot every class's arms draw from was sitting roughly a third of the way down the torso rather
  than at the top edge near the neck. One constant change fixes this for every class at once.
- **Redesigned Blowdart's rendering** — replaced its continuous-angle arm/pipe rig (the same
  fragile pattern that kept causing detached-looking limbs) with a simple left/right facing flip:
  one arm fixed in a mouth-held pose, mirrored depending on which side it's shooting toward,
  instead of tracking an arbitrary rotation angle.
- Removed the static version line from README.md — it duplicated the in-game version display and
  was easy to forget updating, causing it to silently drift out of sync.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-09-02

Class identity overhaul: three starting towers with a full evolution tree, a real stat system
with archetype preferences and diminishing returns, and a much deeper combat layer (poison, holy
damage, accuracy). Also a significant mobile/rendering pass — this was the single largest patch
since 1.0.0.

**Class archetypes & evolution**
- Only Swordsman, Archer, and Mage are directly buildable now. Every other class — Axeman,
  Spearman, Hammerman, Gatling, Blowdart, Bomber, Cleric — is reached by investing 10+ points into
  a specific stat on one of those three, a one-way transformation that keeps accumulated stats.
- New second-tier evolution: Blowdart → Dual Squirt Gun at 25 DEX, twin water pistols spraying
  corrosive green acid.
- Every class belongs to one of three archetypes (Warrior/STR, Archer-style/DEX, Mage/INT) — a
  tower's favored stat is 25% more effective per point than the same investment on a mismatched
  class.
- Diminishing returns on every stat: every 5 points invested, the next 5 are worth progressively
  less, down to a 25% floor.
- Some classes cap out early on a stat that doesn't fit their identity — Mage/Cleric/all four
  melee classes plateau on accuracy at 15 DEX; Archer plateaus on HP at 15 STR.

**Stat effects**
- STR: damage and max HP. DEX: attack speed, accuracy (new miss-chance system, 12% base), and
  🍀 Luck — bonus gold per kill. INT: range, plus class-specific bonuses (Mage's own damage,
  Archer's own damage, Blowdart/Squirt Gun's poison strength).
- Random stat growth on every level-up (0-2 in each stat, plus a bonus 1-2 in the favored stat),
  on top of manually-spendable points (bumped from 3 to 4 per level).
- 100 total stats invested makes a tower Legendary — name it, permanent +10% size, +5% max HP,
  +5% damage reduction.

**Combat & status effects**
- Poison (Blowdart/Squirt Gun), holy damage bonus vs. undead (Cleric's smite, 1.5x + armor
  bypass), chain lightning on the Mage's shock proc.
- A tower that hits 0 HP is now locked out of action for the next 2 full rounds, not just a
  short timer.
- Kill streaks retuned: 1.2s window between kills (was too forgiving), splash/cone hits only
  count once toward a streak regardless of how many enemies they kill at once.

**New enemies & towers**
- Zombie, Wraith, Skeleton (revives once), Wolf (pack speed bonus) — Zombie/Wraith/Skeleton
  tagged undead, vulnerable to holy damage.
- Cleric tower — heals the board's lowest-HP tower once per round (multiple Clerics coordinate,
  never piling onto the same target), separately smites nearby undead.
- 6 procedurally-generated wave archetypes past wave 15 (Swarm Surge, Elite Vanguard, Undead
  Uprising, Ambush Tactics, Siege Assault, Standard) instead of one scaling formula forever.

**Rendering & animation**
- Every weapon-holding class now has both arms genuinely rendered and connected — several classes
  had been missing an off-hand entirely, or had one frozen independently of the weapon arm's
  actual swing/aim angle.
- Idle stance (no target): both arms at a symmetric 45°, weapon held up, independent of arm angle.
  Engaged: weapon points/swings at the target, off-hand counterbalances opposite it.
- Fixed heads rendering as ovals instead of circles — the head was drawn as a perfect circle, but
  after each class's own non-uniform body scale had already been applied to the canvas transform,
  so the circle was getting stretched by that ratio. Radii are now pre-compensated per class.
- Weapon visual length now scales with a tower's actual range (INT investment).

**Mobile & UI**
- Fixed the root cause of the game needing "Desktop site" mode to render correctly on phones — a
  hard CSS block was completely hiding the game whenever the screen was portrait, and separately a
  camera-clamp formula assumed the viewport and the world were always the same size.
- Canvas now fills the actual window at native resolution instead of a fixed letterboxed frame.
- Consolidated two separate "?" info buttons into one comprehensive help modal.
- Moved the Expand button into the Build menu to reclaim HUD space.

- Swordsman attack speed increased (~13-15% shorter cooldown across all tiers).
- Archer attack speed decreased (~13-15% longer draw + cooldown cycle across all tiers) to better
  balance its higher per-shot damage from the draw mechanic.
- Inspect panel stat display reworked: STR/DEX/INT no longer look like disabled/dimmed buttons —
  they stay normal-colored always, gain a green glow specifically when points are available to
  spend, and use a recessed inset-shadow "slider" style instead of a flat raised-button background
  so they read as a display, not a clickable action. Info icons (❓) for STATS and INVENTORY moved
  to sit before their labels and lost their button chrome (plain glyph, no circle/border).

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-31

First versioned release. Baseline snapshot of the full feature set built up to this point.

- **8 tower classes plus Barricade** (Swordsman, Archer, Axeman, Spearman, Hammerman, Mage, Bomber,
  Gatling) — each with a distinct color identity, body build, and combat role, so classes read as
  visually distinct at a glance rather than reskins of the same figure.
- **Archer draw mechanic** — the bow now visibly charges before firing instead of snapping to a
  static pose; slower arrows but real damage behind a completed draw, because the old instant-fire
  archer didn't read as an archer at all.
- **Expanding spiral map** — starts as a tiny 2x2 area (half path, half buildable), and grows ring
  by ring as waves clear. Expansions alternate between extending the path as a connected spiral
  loop and adding pure buildable space, so the map both winds outward visually and gives you room
  to build, rather than regenerating into a disconnected new shape each time.
- **Barricade** — a non-attacking, path-placeable obstacle. Freezes the first enemy that touches it
  (and anything queued behind it, spaced so they never overlap) — HP only drops from actual hits,
  rate-limited to 1 point per 2 seconds, because a passive timer didn't feel like a "health" stat.
- **Breakaway enemies** — Fire and Ice types (and a small chance for any enemy) can leave the path
  entirely to attack a tower directly, inflicting burn or a slow debuff on it. Gives towers actual
  stakes beyond just DPS math.
- **Troll enemy** — big bounty, walks backward toward the entrance instead of forward, and can
  swing at a nearby tower to drop debris that costs gold to clear.
- **Hero item system** — every tower starts with free class gear; better gear (Iron/Gold/Masterwork)
  is bought per-class from the Shop, plus global passives that apply to every tower owned. A tower
  with all 4 slots filled awakens as a Hero with a permanent stat bonus.
- **Infinite waves** — procedurally scaled difficulty continues past wave 15, since this is meant
  to support long hero-building sessions rather than end at a fixed wave count.
- **Settings menu** — Video (graphics quality), Audio (mute), Game (18+ gore toggle, save/load),
  About (in-app README viewer/downloader).
- **Save / Load** — full game state serializes to a downloadable `.txt` file with a random seed
  header; restorable on this device or any other. Save files are stamped with the game version.
- Numerous balance passes (Swordsman attack speed up, Archer attack speed down, melee swing arc
  widened so it reliably hits everything within its stated range) and bug fixes (an upgrade-cost
  method name colliding with a same-named tier data field, which silently broke every tower upgrade
  past the first one; a Barricade HP display bug caused by a generic regen system applying to a
  tower type it shouldn't have; map generation that could leave zero buildable tiles in a small
  starting region).
