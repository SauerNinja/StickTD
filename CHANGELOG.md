See `AGENTS.md` for the workflow this file follows. See `BACKLOG.md` for ideas not yet built.

## [1.0.45] - 2026-09-03

- **Fixed projectiles spawning too low** — found the actual bug: the muzzle offset formula was
  purely radial from the tower's ground-level base position, completely omitting the fixed
  shoulder-height offset (`shoulderY = -13`) every class's arm/weapon pivots from before extending
  outward along the aim angle. For the most common case — a roughly horizontal shot at a
  similarly-positioned enemy — the old formula added zero vertical correction at all, so arrows
  spawned from the tower's dead-center ground point instead of ~15 world units up at actual bow
  height. Fixed both spawn sites (the main projectile function and Axeman's thrown axe) by adding
  the same fixed shoulder baseline the render-time hand position already uses, verified with real
  numbers before shipping rather than assumed correct from the formula alone.

## [1.0.44] - 2026-09-03

- **Fixed the close button overlapping the chevron** — moved `#inspClose` out of the flex flow
  entirely and absolutely-positioned it to the panel's own top-right corner, so it can never
  compete for space with the nameplate's chevron again.
- **Condensed the HP bar to real WoW scale** — was stretching edge-to-edge across the whole panel
  via `flex:1 1 auto`; capped the nameplate's middle column to a fixed 170px and shrank the bar
  height, matching how compact real WoW unit frames actually are.
- **Added an evolution-progress bar** — checked first and confirmed there's no actual numeric
  EXP/kill-count system in this game at all; leveling is entirely gold-purchased tier upgrades.
  Rather than fabricate a fake progress bar with no underlying data, built this against what's
  actually real: progress toward the nearest stat-based evolution threshold, honestly hidden for
  classes with no further evolution path (Spearman, Cleric, Squirt Gun, Paladin).
- Logged "expand level cap to 10" and "build a real EXP system" as backlog items rather than
  building them now — both are genuine content/balance projects (7 more tiers × 13 tower configs
  for the level cap alone), not something to fold into a UI polish pass.

## [1.0.43] - 2026-09-02

- **Added exponential-rarity blood stream sizing** — on-hit streams were previously a fixed size
  every time (count=3, no variance). Added an exponential-distribution size roll: verified with a
  20,000-sample simulation that ~58% of hits produce small splatters, ~28% normal, ~10% big, and
  only ~3.4% genuinely huge — a real long-tail rarity curve, not a flat random range. Floored at
  0.6x so blood is never absent on any hit (confirmed the floor still produces ~88-95% of baseline
  size, never zero), capped at 4.5x so the rare huge case stays dramatic without running away
  (up to 2.2x longer, ~2x thicker, nearly 3x as many streams). Both existing call sites (on-hit
  and on-death) get this automatically since the new parameter is optional and backward-compatible
  — death streams now share the same rarity curve as a free consistency win.

## [1.0.42] - 2026-09-02

- **Rebuilt the nameplate to actually look like a WoW nameplate** — added a circular portrait
  frame showing the tower's icon as its "face", a proper HP bar (fill + text overlay, green
  gradient) instead of no health visual at all, and replaced the small inline chevron text with
  a genuinely obvious bordered button (32x32, gold border, higher contrast). Verified every new
  element has exactly one HTML definition and consistent JS references before shipping — full
  syntax and HTML tag-balance checks both passed clean.
- Confirmed the Cleric fixes from the prior message were already shipped (v1.0.40) rather than
  redoing duplicate work — the uploaded screenshot and document were repeats of the same context.

## [1.0.41] - 2026-09-02

- **Added periodic status-effect reminder labels** — burn, curse, slow, and stun on enemies (and
  burn/slow on towers, from breakaway attacks) now surface floating text naming the active status
  every 120 seconds, not just at the moment it's applied. Long-running effects were easy to lose
  track of otherwise. Confirmed `spawnFloatingText`'s actual signature before wiring calls to it
  rather than assuming.
- **Process change**: added `BACKLOG.md` alongside `CHANGELOG.md`, and updated `AGENTS.md` to
  capture ideas and suggestions as they come up mid-conversation, not just completed work.

## [1.0.40] - 2026-09-02

- **Fixed Cleric only ever attacking undead** — confirmed the exact bug: `if(!e.isUndead) continue`
  skipped every non-undead enemy in target selection, meaning Cleric was effectively non-functional
  whenever no undead were nearby. Now targets the nearest enemy of any type.
- **Cleric is now a curse-DoT, not a single instant hit** — reused the existing poison/DoT
  infrastructure (`applyPoison`) instead of a burst `applyDamage` call. Deals 5x tick damage
  against undead specifically. Verified the actual tick math against the real 600ms poison tick
  interval rather than assuming a fixed tick count — undead take up to 138 total damage at max
  tier, normal enemies a real but modest 15-30.
- **Fixed Cleric's damage dropping on evolution from Mage** — confirmed with real numbers: Mage's
  max tier (13) was higher than Cleric's base tier (6), meaning a fully-upgraded Mage evolving into
  Cleric was a straight downgrade. Rescaled Cleric to 14/20/28 — even its base tier now exceeds
  Mage's fully-upgraded one.
- **Fixed the idle pose holding a cross overhead permanently** — the raised casting-arm gesture
  was unconditional every frame, idle or not. Now only raises toward the target while actively
  casting; rests at a natural side position when idle, matching the pattern used by every other
  class in the file.


- **Fixed the compact/expand feature being completely non-functional** — while checking "anything
  else" after the nameplate redesign, found that `#inspFullOptions` had zero matching CSS anywhere
  in the file. Every other `.hidden` toggle in this codebase is defined per-element (there's no
  shared generic rule), and this element never got its own — meaning the JS was correctly toggling
  the class the whole time, but nothing told the browser what that class should actually do to
  this element. The full options section had been showing unconditionally regardless of expand
  state since the feature was built. Added the missing rule and reverified both the JS syntax and
  full HTML tag balance before shipping.

## [1.0.39] - 2026-09-02

- **Fixed the compact/expand feature being completely non-functional** — while checking "anything
  else" after the nameplate redesign, found that `#inspFullOptions` had zero matching CSS anywhere
  in the file. Every other `.hidden` toggle in this codebase is defined per-element (there's no
  shared generic rule), and this element never got its own — meaning the JS was correctly toggling
  the class the whole time, but nothing told the browser what that class should actually do to
  this element. The full options section had been showing unconditionally regardless of expand
  state since the feature was built. Added the missing rule and reverified both the JS syntax and
  full HTML tag balance before shipping.

## [1.0.38] - 2026-09-02

- **Redesigned the panel toggle to match real WC3 nameplate behavior** — removed the separate
  "⌄ Options" button entirely. Tapping the nameplate itself (name + level) now toggles between
  compact and full view, with just a small chevron indicating it's expandable, rather than a
  labeled button explaining what to do. Added proper tap styling (active-state highlight, pointer
  cursor) since no CSS existed for these elements before. Verified full HTML tag balance and
  confirmed no dangling references to the removed button anywhere in the file before shipping.

## [1.0.37] - 2026-09-02

- **Tapping a tower now shows a compact view first, with a "⌄ Options" button to open the full
  panel** — matches the requested WC3/WoW nameplate flow (tap the unit, get basic info, use a
  button to expand into full options) without building a separate canvas-tracked floating overlay,
  which would have needed real-time world-to-screen projection and carried genuine risk of
  positioning edge cases. Reused the existing bottom panel instead: compact by default (name,
  level, combat stats), full options (upgrade/move/sell/target/stats/inventory) collapsed behind
  the button, resetting to compact every time a different tower is newly selected.
- **Caught a genuinely dangerous bug before shipping this** — a bulk find-and-replace used to add
  the reset logic across 10 call sites matched a substring inside the variable's own `let`
  declaration line, inserting an assignment to `inspPanelExpanded` *before* its declaration. This
  is a temporal-dead-zone violation that would have thrown a ReferenceError and crashed the
  entire game on page load — and critically, `node --check` (syntax-only) does not catch this
  class of bug at all, since the code is syntactically valid. Found it by manually reviewing every
  insertion site rather than trusting the syntax check alone, then verified the fix with an actual
  Node execution simulating the real declaration order, not just a re-run of `--check`.

## [1.0.36] - 2026-09-02

- **Fixed remaining projectile-spawn precision errors** — checked every class's muzzle offset
  formula directly against its exact render geometry rather than trusting the earlier
  approximations. Confirmed Mage, Bomber, Gatling, and Squirt Gun were already exact matches
  (no change needed). Found two real, confirmed discrepancies: Blowdart's formula was missing the
  weaponScale multiplier on the pipe length (9.7px error at max INT investment — nearly a third
  of the correct offset), and Archer was missing the +2 draw-tension term the render math applies
  at full draw (2.3px error). Also confirmed the bow's visual midpoint is exactly at the hand
  position (bowTop/bowBot are both offset perpendicular from the hand, not from a further point),
  so "spawns from the middle of the bow" was already structurally correct — the fix was in the
  reach distance leading up to that point, not the concept.

## [1.0.35] - 2026-09-02

- **Added an upgrade-available glow** — a pulsing golden ring appears around any tower that's
  below max level *and* currently affordable, visible directly on the map without needing to
  select the tower first. Confirmed this didn't already exist anywhere in the codebase before
  building it — no nametag or upgrade-indicator system was present at all.
- **Note on scope**: full WC3/WoW-style floating nametags above every active tower (name, level,
  HP bar, expandable panel) is a substantially larger feature — real-time world-to-screen
  projection for potentially 20+ simultaneous towers, with a real risk of cluttering the screen.
  Built the concrete, immediately useful piece (the glow) rather than the full overlay system in
  the same pass; the existing bottom inspect panel already covers stats/leveling once a tower is
  selected.

## [1.0.34] - 2026-09-02

- **Bomber and Gatling now have distinguishing gear** — audited every class and confirmed these
  two (plus Spearman) were the only ones with zero accessory of any kind. Gave Bomber a shell
  pouch on the hip and Gatling an ammo belt across the chest with cartridge marks (reused the
  same geometry already verified clear of the head from the bandolier work). Left Spearman as-is
  — a spear alone is a complete look and doesn't need added gear the way a gunner does.
- **Confirmed no save/load gap from this session's visual work** — checked `serializeGameState()`
  directly: weaponScale, weaponThickness, and decals are all computed fresh from stats (str/dex/
  int/range) that were already being saved, not separate state that needed new persistence.

## [1.0.33] - 2026-09-02

- **Quiver gap widened slightly** — was still reading as a bit too attached to the body.
- **Blowdart now has a hip pouch** instead of no back accessory at all — a small dart pouch on
  the hip, opposite the throwing hand.
- **Squirt Gun now has a bandolier** instead of no accessory — crossed straps across the torso
  with cartridge dots, fitting a dual-gunner better than a quiver would. Verified the bandolier's
  top point stays clear of the head before shipping.

## [1.0.32] - 2026-09-02

- **Blood decals now grow and settle over time instead of appearing instantly at full size** —
  each stain tracks its own spawn time; blobs start small and expand to full size over 0.7
  seconds (verified with the actual curve math), then the whole decal darkens/settles to 75%
  opacity over the next few seconds and holds there permanently — a lasting stain, not a
  vanishing effect.
- **Added occasional directional cast-off streaks** — real blood spatter travels away from where
  the strike came from, not radially outward like a splash. ~40% of kills (when the attacking
  tower is known) now spawn a growing line decal along that actual attacker-to-target angle,
  alongside the normal splatter.

## [1.0.31] - 2026-09-02

- **Quiver no longer merges into the body** — was touching the torso flush at x=0; given a small
  gap plus a visible shoulder strap connecting it to the body, so it reads as worn on a strap
  instead of fused into the silhouette.
- **Blood puddles are only sometimes messy now, not every time** — the extra scattered decals were
  guaranteed on every single kill. Made them probabilistic: verified the actual resulting split —
  65% of kills leave one clean stain, ~35% get the messier multi-splatter look. Every kill still
  leaves a mark, just not maximum chaos every time.

## [1.0.30] - 2026-09-02

- **Projectiles now spawn from the actual weapon tip instead of the tower's center** — confirmed
  the bug: every arrow, bolt, staff blast, and mortar shell was spawning from `this.x, this.y`
  regardless of where the weapon visually is. Fixed for all 6 ranged classes (Archer, Mage,
  Bomber, Gatling, Blowdart, Squirt Gun) plus Axeman's thrown axe — found this was a second,
  separate code path that would've been missed if only the main projectile function was checked.
  The offset replicates the same local-space reach (arm length + weapon length) used when
  rendering the stickman, converted to world-space, so it scales correctly with weaponScale (INT
  investment) exactly like the visible weapon does — verified with real numbers across every
  class and both ends of the INT range (20-40px offsets, growing correctly where the weapon
  itself grows, fixed where it doesn't).

## [1.0.29] - 2026-09-02

- **Quiver rebuilt per spec** — replaced the abstract line-fan with an actual rectangular quiver
  body (filled, outlined) with three arrow shafts and fletching sticking out the top, its inner
  edge touching the torso directly instead of floating disconnected or being hidden behind it.
  Also flipped the side logic — was on the same side as the facing direction, now correctly on
  the opposite side (facing right → quiver on the left, and vice versa). Caught the fletching tips
  poking 2 units into the head with the initial position before shipping, adjusted and reverified
  clear.

## [1.0.28] - 2026-09-02

- **Added a rare "massive pool" tier to blood decals** — was previously a binary normal/big split
  (80%/20%); now a three-tier system where ~70% stay ordinary, ~22% come out noticeably bigger,
  and ~7% are genuinely massive splatters (up to 5x the size of a typical pool). Verified the
  actual distribution and size ranges with a 5000-sample simulation before shipping, not just
  eyeballed the probabilities.

## [1.0.27] - 2026-09-02

- **Actually fixed the quiver rendering in front of the body instead of behind it** — the previous
  three attempts only adjusted its X/Y position, but the real bug was draw order: the quiver was
  drawn *after* the torso, so it always rendered on top regardless of where it sat. Also, the
  quiver was positioned far enough from center (±6 units) that the torso's own line never actually
  overlapped it, so even correct draw order alone wouldn't have occluded anything — verified this
  with the actual geometry before attempting a fix. Brought the quiver base in to ±2 units from
  center and now explicitly redraw the torso on top of it with a deliberately widened stroke,
  confirmed with real numbers to genuinely cover the quiver base this time.

## [1.0.26] - 2026-09-02

- **Screen shake now only triggers on Boss kills** — every single enemy death was shaking the
  screen, which gets tiring fast during dense waves with dozens of kills. Regular kills keep all
  the gore (streams, gibs, particles, decals) but stay visually calm; Bosses stay impactful.

## [1.0.25] - 2026-09-02

- **Real flowing blood streams with water physics** — new particle type that tracks its previous
  position each tick and renders as a genuine connected line (not a dot or dash), tapering in
  width as it loses momentum. Verified with actual physics math: the stream arcs downward under
  gravity while decelerating, exactly like a real jet of liquid rather than scattered dust.
  Directional on hit (uses the actual angle from attacker to target), radiating outward on death.
- **Fixed the Archer's quiver still overlapping the head** — lowered it to back/shoulder-blade
  height and shortened the arrow fan; verified the new top edge sits well below the head boundary
  instead of extending past it.

## [1.0.24] - 2026-09-02

- **Gore now scales with the size of the kill** — a Swarm death is a smaller burst than a Tank or
  Boss death, instead of every kill spawning an identical amount of gore regardless of how tough
  the enemy was. Scales off the enemy's own maxHp, bounded between 0.7x and 1.8x so it stays
  proportional without Bosses spawning an absurd particle count.
- **Subtle idle breathing sway** — towers with no target now have a small vertical bob instead of
  standing perfectly rigid. Each tower's phase is offset by its own position so a row of idle
  towers doesn't all bob in unison.

## [1.0.23] - 2026-09-02

- **Fixed the Archer's quiver on the wrong side of the back** — flipped its position, and made it
  dynamically mirror based on facing direction (was a fixed position regardless of which way the
  Archer was aiming), so it stays correct whichever direction the tower faces, not just the one
  snapshot it was reported in.

## [1.0.22] - 2026-09-02

- **All arms now connect at exactly one shared shoulder point** instead of two nearby-but-distinct
  offset points (was ±1.5-4 units apart depending on class). Applied to all 26 occurrences across
  every weapon-holding class.
- **Chest plate redesigned as a tapered trapezoid** — narrow at the top, widening toward the
  waist, instead of a uniform-width bar. Also moved its top edge from y=-16 down to y=-10, giving
  7 units of real clearance from the neck (was reaching almost up to it).

## [1.0.21] - 2026-09-02

- **Fixed the Archer's drawing-arm shoulder sitting almost on the neck** — verified with real
  coordinates: the back shoulder was landing just 0.5 units below the head/neck boundary when
  facing horizontally, from a shoulder offset (3.5) that was too large. Reduced to 1.8, which
  pulls it to 2.2 units of clearance — over 4x more room — confirmed with the same math before
  shipping, not just eyeballed.

## [1.0.20] - 2026-09-02

- **Armor now draws on top of arms instead of being crossed over by them** — the chest plate
  (level 2+) and helmet (level 3+) were rendered before the arms, so arm lines cut across and
  obscured them. Moved armor rendering to happen after everything else instead.
- **Increased weapon size growth per INT investment** — first attempt at this actually made growth
  *slower* (verified the mistake with real numbers before shipping it, then reverted). The
  correct fix: increased the actual min/max size targets for all 8 classes by roughly 15-30%
  rather than changing the growth curve itself. Confirmed with real numbers that the same amount
  of INT investment now produces a visibly bigger weapon (e.g. Swordsman: 17.5 units old vs. 19.0
  new, at the same realistic investment level) while the zero-INT baseline size didn't shrink.
  Re-verified head clearance against every new max size — Swordsman and Two-Hander needed more
  conservative caps (23/24 instead of an initially-planned 26/30) to stay clear.

## [1.0.19] - 2026-09-02

- **Restored upright weapons when idle/between rounds** — a couple versions ago these were
  switched to hang downward to sidestep a head-clearance issue with the bigger weapon sizes, but
  upright reads better and was the original design intent. Restored the 55°-tilted upright pose
  and re-verified with real numbers (not assumed from before) that every class's current actual
  max size still clears the head at this angle — all 7 confirmed clear, none needed further
  adjustment.

## [1.0.18] - 2026-09-02

- **Fixed the Archer's drawing-arm elbow bending unnaturally upward when facing right (or left)**
  — traced the exact cause: the back shoulder's own offset already sits above center when facing
  horizontally, and the old perpendicular elbow-kick compounded in that same direction, stacking
  the elbow well above the shoulder. Replaced the perpendicular kick with a fixed downward droop,
  matching real archery form (the drawing elbow stays level or drops slightly, never rises).
  Verified with real coordinates for the exact "facing right" case reported — the elbow now sits
  below the shoulder instead of stacked above it, and this holds at every facing direction since
  the droop no longer depends on aim angle at all.

## [1.0.17] - 2026-09-02

- **Fixed the off-hand crossing to the wrong side of the body while swinging** — last version's
  vertical clamp only stopped it from swinging up into the air, but didn't stop the horizontal
  case: when the weapon swings toward the left, its "exact opposite" angle points right, sending
  the off-hand (anchored on the left shoulder) reaching all the way across the body. Confirmed
  this with real angle math before touching code. Rather than patching the direction-tracking
  approach a third time, replaced it entirely — the off-hand is now fixed at its natural resting
  angle regardless of the weapon's swing direction, so there is no longer any possible angle where
  it can cross the body or swing upward, verified by testing it against five different weapon
  angles and confirming the output is now identical every time. Applied to all 6 classes that
  shared the old pattern (Swordsman, Spearman, Mage, Bomber, Gatling, Cleric).

## [1.0.16] - 2026-09-02

- **Fixed the off-hand swinging up into the air while attacking** — it counterbalanced the exact
  opposite of the weapon arm's swing angle, which is correct most of the time but points straight
  up whenever the enemy being fought happens to be above the tower. Clamped so it reflects back
  downward instead, keeping the same left/right lean without ever raising into the air. Verified
  across five different swing scenarios (enemy above, below, left, right, diagonal) — the exact
  "enemy above" case that broke before now stays correctly grounded. Applied to all 6 affected
  classes (Swordsman, Spearman, Mage, Bomber, Gatling, Cleric).
- **Fixed a color mismatch on the Archer** — the nocked arrow shown mid-draw was brown, but the
  actual fired arrow projectile is yellow/gold. Matched them so the same arrow looks consistent
  whether it's being drawn or already in flight.

## [1.0.15] - 2026-09-02

- **Weapons are noticeably bigger at base, and STR now makes them thicker** — added a new
  `weaponThickness` stat (diminishing returns, capped at 1.8x) applied to blade width, crossguard
  size, hilt size, and equivalent head/tip geometry across every weapon-holding class. INT still
  controls length via the existing system, now with meaningfully larger min/max ranges per class
  (e.g. Swordsman went from 9-12.5 to 14-24 units).
- The bigger base sizes meant the old straight-up idle pose no longer had enough vertical
  clearance below the head, so idle weapons across all affected classes now tilt 55° instead of
  pointing straight up — verified with real numbers that every single class's new maximum size
  stays clear of the head at this angle, not just guessed at.

## [1.0.14] - 2026-09-02

- **Fixed arms visually floating away from the torso** — every two-armed class positioned its
  arms starting ±3 to ±4 units to either side of the torso's centerline, with nothing drawn to
  bridge that gap, so arms read as disconnected from the body. Reduced to ±1.5 across all 15
  affected call sites (still enough separation to distinguish left/right, but close enough to
  read as actually attached).
- **Fixed the Archer's drawing-arm elbow flaring the wrong way** — the elbow kick used a fixed
  rotational formula independent of which side the back shoulder actually sits on, so depending
  on which direction the Archer was facing, the elbow could bend toward the body instead of away
  from it. Now kicks in the same direction the back shoulder is already offset, which is
  guaranteed correct regardless of facing — verified across all four cardinal directions, not
  just the one that happened to look right during testing.

## [1.0.13] - 2026-09-02

- **Found and removed the actual root cause of every "extra limb" report across this entire
  session.** There was a leftover global block — drawn unconditionally, for every class except
  Axeman and dual/two-hander Swordsman specs, completely outside the careful per-class off-hand
  systems that were built afterward — that stamped a hardcoded extra arm-like line (0,-12) to
  (-10,-2) on top of everything else, every single frame. Every class already had its own correct
  off-hand logic; this was pure leftover dead code silently drawing a genuine extra limb on top of
  it the whole time. Manually verified (not just scripted) that Swordsman, Mage, and Spearman each
  render exactly the arms they should — no more, no less — with this block gone.

## [1.0.12] - 2026-09-02

- **Fixed weapon size changing when a tower swings/fires** — idle and engaged poses were computing
  weapon length from two entirely different formulas (a short idle-safe base vs. the old full
  combat length), so the weapon visibly grew or shrank depending on whether the tower had a
  target. Replaced with a single shared function (`weaponLenFromScale`) that both states now call
  identically — same length whether idle or mid-swing, only INT/range investment changes it.
- Every weapon-holding class now has an explicit min length (at no INT invested) and max length
  (at that class's own range cap), verified with real numbers: min is hit exactly at baseline,
  max is hit exactly at the range cap, and the value never overshoots even against out-of-range
  inputs. Applied to all 8 classes — Swordsman, Axeman, Spearman, Hammerman, Mage, Bomber,
  Gatling, and Squirt Gun.

## [1.0.11] - 2026-09-02

- **Fixed weapon growth (INT/range investment) being completely invisible when idle** — a
  regression from the head-overlap fix two versions ago. Proved it with real numbers: every
  weaponScale from 1.0x to 1.6x was clamping to the exact same length, meaning INT investment had
  zero visible effect on idle weapon size, for all 7 affected classes (Swordsman, Spearman,
  Hammerman, Mage, Bomber, Gatling, Squirt Gun). The fix: idle poses now use their own shorter
  base length sized to fit entirely within the safe head-clearance budget, so growth is visible
  at every single step across the realistic range, while the clamp remains as a safety net only
  for genuinely extreme edge cases (e.g. a maxed-out Two-Hander).
- **Lowered the shoulder pivot slightly** (y=-15 → y=-13) — the previous "attach arms at the
  body's edge" fix had overcorrected a bit too high.

## [1.0.10] - 2026-09-02

- **Random pool-size variance** — roughly 1 in 5 blood pools now come out dramatically bigger
  (verified: up to 2.6x larger at the extreme, not just marginal noise), with more blobs and a
  wider spread, so the ground doesn't fill up with uniform puddles.
- Pushed overall gore further: more particles in every layer, more gib debris per kill (up to 10
  at high graphics), and a third scattered stain per death for a genuinely messy, uneven pool
  rather than a tidy ring around the kill point.

## [1.0.9] - 2026-09-02

- **Fixed Archer's drawing arm — the real cause of the recurring "extra limb" look.** The string
  arm was using the same generic fixed-segment-ratio arm function as every other class, but that
  function assumes a roughly full-length reach. Pulling it in close (as short as 6 units, early
  in the draw animation) forced the upper arm and forearm into a cramped, overlapping fold that
  read as an extra limb. Replaced with proper geometry for this specific case: the string hand
  slides back from the bow grip along the aim axis exactly like a real draw motion, and the elbow
  kicks out perpendicular to the shoulder-to-hand line so it stays clean at any pull distance.
  Verified with real geometry math across the full draw cycle (0% to 100%) — both arm segments
  stay a sane, non-degenerate length the entire time, no collapse at any point.

## [1.0.8] - 2026-09-02

- **Significantly escalated gore intensity** — main blood burst nearly doubled (22→42 particles),
  added a third bright high-velocity spray layer, and a new tumbling "gib" debris system (chunky
  rotating squares, distinct from the fine spray, with heavier physics). Pooling decals now spawn
  two overlapping stains per death instead of one, each with more and larger splatter blobs.
  Screen shake on kill increased and lasts longer. On-hit spray (not just kills) also boosted, so
  every hit reads as visceral, not just the kill itself.
- Fixed a real bug caught before shipping the above: the particle pool is reused in a circular
  buffer, so a slot previously used for the new gib debris could leak its rotating-square render
  mode into a later, unrelated particle spawn. Every regular particle spawn now explicitly resets
  that flag.

## [1.0.7] - 2026-09-02

- **Extended curated waves from 20 to 100** — rather than hand-typing 80 one-off arrays (slow,
  error-prone, hard to balance consistently), built on the existing procedural-wave formulas and
  added two new archetypes: 🃏 Trick (opens deceptively weak, then springs Splitters/Trolls/Tanks
  mid-wave) and ⛏️ Grind (a long, widely-spaced slog testing sustained DPS and economy rather than
  burst reaction). Waves cycle through 7 archetypes with a dedicated 👑 Boss milestone every 10th
  wave (30, 40, 50...100), all baked into real, concrete wave definitions rather than left to
  run-time randomness.
- Caught and fixed a real overflow bug during generation: the original count-scaling formulas,
  uncapped, would have produced a 698-enemy wave by wave 98 — nearly 3x the enemy pool's actual
  220-object capacity, meaning most of that wave would have silently failed to spawn. Capped the
  scaling input so the worst-case wave (157 enemies) stays safely under the pool limit.
- The wave-type toast (previously only shown for waves beyond the hand-authored range) now also
  fires for these new curated waves, so the Trick/Grind/Boss distinction is visible in-game.

## [1.0.6] - 2026-09-02

- **Fixed idle weapons overshooting past the head** — a regression from raising the shoulder
  pivot two versions ago (to fix arms attaching at the middle of the body): every class's idle
  "weapon held straight up" pose never got re-checked against the new, higher shoulder position,
  so the sword/staff/hammer/etc. tip was crossing up into the head — confirmed with actual
  geometry math, not just a guess (blade tip landed inside the head's circle at every weapon
  scale, even the base case). Added a shared clamp so any idle weapon's upward reach is capped
  just below the head, applied to all 7 affected classes (Swordsman, Spearman, Hammerman, Mage,
  Bomber, Gatling, Squirt Gun) from one shared function.

## [1.0.5] - 2026-09-02

- **Gravity on gore particles** — the blood burst on hit/death now arcs and falls instead of
  spraying out in a flat radial pattern, reading as actual directional spray rather than a
  generic particle puff. Every other particle use (gold pickups, sparkles, star effects) is
  unaffected — gravity is opt-in per spawn.
- **Persistent ground blood decals** — enemy deaths in gore mode now leave a permanent pooling
  stain on the ground (a few overlapping irregular blobs, not a plain circle), capped at 150
  active stains on a circular buffer so it stays performance-safe over a long session. Clears on
  a new game and immediately when gore mode is turned off.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-09-02

- **Extended curated waves from 15 to 20** — 5 new hand-authored waves escalating through the full
  enemy roster (heavier Tank/Zombie/Wraith combinations, denser Swarm/Wolf floods, an Undead
  Uprising, and a Shielded/Splitter gauntlet), ending in a bigger 2-Boss finale at wave 20.
  Procedural generation still takes over seamlessly past that, unchanged.
- **Steeper per-wave HP scaling** — 20% growth per wave instead of 15%, so difficulty ramps up
  meaningfully faster across the whole game, not just in the new waves.
- Confirmed Barricades were already correctly restricted to path tiles only (this had been flagged
  as possibly missing — checked the actual code and it was already implemented correctly).

## [1.0.3] - 2026-09-02

- **Fixed DEX/INT damage bonuses not applying to evolved classes** — the check was against a
  tower's literal type (`'ARCHER'`, `'MAGE'`) rather than its archetype, so Blowdart, Squirt Gun,
  Gatling, Bomber, and Cleric all silently lost their own archetype's primary damage scaling the
  moment they evolved. Now checks archetype, so every class in a family keeps its stat scaling
  through every evolution stage.
- Added an Attack Speed stat (⚡, attacks/second) to the tower inspect panel — previously only
  visible indirectly through cooldown timing, not shown as an actual number anywhere.
- Squirt Gun now renders holding actual pistol emoji (🔫) instead of plain grey line-shapes.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-09-02

- **Fixed arms attaching at the middle of the body instead of the shoulder** — the shared shoulder
  pivot every class's arms draw from was sitting roughly a third of the way down the torso rather
  than at the top edge near the neck. One constant change fixes this for every class at once.
- **Redesigned Blowdart's rendering** — replaced its continuous-angle arm/pipe rig (the same
  fragile pattern that kept causing detached-looking limbs) with a simple left/right facing flip:
  one arm fixed in a mouth-held pose, mirrored depending on which side it's shooting toward,
  instead of tracking an arbitrary rotation angle.
- Removed the static version line from README.md — it duplicated the in-game version display and
  was easy to forget updating, causing it to silently drift out of sync.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-09-02

Class identity overhaul: three starting towers with a full evolution tree, a real stat system
with archetype preferences and diminishing returns, and a much deeper combat layer (poison, holy
damage, accuracy). Also a significant mobile/rendering pass — this was the single largest patch
since 1.0.0.

**Class archetypes & evolution**
- Only Swordsman, Archer, and Mage are directly buildable now. Every other class — Axeman,
  Spearman, Hammerman, Gatling, Blowdart, Bomber, Cleric — is reached by investing 10+ points into
  a specific stat on one of those three, a one-way transformation that keeps accumulated stats.
- New second-tier evolution: Blowdart → Dual Squirt Gun at 25 DEX, twin water pistols spraying
  corrosive green acid.
- Every class belongs to one of three archetypes (Warrior/STR, Archer-style/DEX, Mage/INT) — a
  tower's favored stat is 25% more effective per point than the same investment on a mismatched
  class.
- Diminishing returns on every stat: every 5 points invested, the next 5 are worth progressively
  less, down to a 25% floor.
- Some classes cap out early on a stat that doesn't fit their identity — Mage/Cleric/all four
  melee classes plateau on accuracy at 15 DEX; Archer plateaus on HP at 15 STR.

**Stat effects**
- STR: damage and max HP. DEX: attack speed, accuracy (new miss-chance system, 12% base), and
  🍀 Luck — bonus gold per kill. INT: range, plus class-specific bonuses (Mage's own damage,
  Archer's own damage, Blowdart/Squirt Gun's poison strength).
- Random stat growth on every level-up (0-2 in each stat, plus a bonus 1-2 in the favored stat),
  on top of manually-spendable points (bumped from 3 to 4 per level).
- 100 total stats invested makes a tower Legendary — name it, permanent +10% size, +5% max HP,
  +5% damage reduction.

**Combat & status effects**
- Poison (Blowdart/Squirt Gun), holy damage bonus vs. undead (Cleric's smite, 1.5x + armor
  bypass), chain lightning on the Mage's shock proc.
- A tower that hits 0 HP is now locked out of action for the next 2 full rounds, not just a
  short timer.
- Kill streaks retuned: 1.2s window between kills (was too forgiving), splash/cone hits only
  count once toward a streak regardless of how many enemies they kill at once.

**New enemies & towers**
- Zombie, Wraith, Skeleton (revives once), Wolf (pack speed bonus) — Zombie/Wraith/Skeleton
  tagged undead, vulnerable to holy damage.
- Cleric tower — heals the board's lowest-HP tower once per round (multiple Clerics coordinate,
  never piling onto the same target), separately smites nearby undead.
- 6 procedurally-generated wave archetypes past wave 15 (Swarm Surge, Elite Vanguard, Undead
  Uprising, Ambush Tactics, Siege Assault, Standard) instead of one scaling formula forever.

**Rendering & animation**
- Every weapon-holding class now has both arms genuinely rendered and connected — several classes
  had been missing an off-hand entirely, or had one frozen independently of the weapon arm's
  actual swing/aim angle.
- Idle stance (no target): both arms at a symmetric 45°, weapon held up, independent of arm angle.
  Engaged: weapon points/swings at the target, off-hand counterbalances opposite it.
- Fixed heads rendering as ovals instead of circles — the head was drawn as a perfect circle, but
  after each class's own non-uniform body scale had already been applied to the canvas transform,
  so the circle was getting stretched by that ratio. Radii are now pre-compensated per class.
- Weapon visual length now scales with a tower's actual range (INT investment).

**Mobile & UI**
- Fixed the root cause of the game needing "Desktop site" mode to render correctly on phones — a
  hard CSS block was completely hiding the game whenever the screen was portrait, and separately a
  camera-clamp formula assumed the viewport and the world were always the same size.
- Canvas now fills the actual window at native resolution instead of a fixed letterboxed frame.
- Consolidated two separate "?" info buttons into one comprehensive help modal.
- Moved the Expand button into the Build menu to reclaim HUD space.

- Swordsman attack speed increased (~13-15% shorter cooldown across all tiers).
- Archer attack speed decreased (~13-15% longer draw + cooldown cycle across all tiers) to better
  balance its higher per-shot damage from the draw mechanic.
- Inspect panel stat display reworked: STR/DEX/INT no longer look like disabled/dimmed buttons —
  they stay normal-colored always, gain a green glow specifically when points are available to
  spend, and use a recessed inset-shadow "slider" style instead of a flat raised-button background
  so they read as a display, not a clickable action. Info icons (❓) for STATS and INVENTORY moved
  to sit before their labels and lost their button chrome (plain glyph, no circle/border).

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-31

First versioned release. Baseline snapshot of the full feature set built up to this point.

- **8 tower classes plus Barricade** (Swordsman, Archer, Axeman, Spearman, Hammerman, Mage, Bomber,
  Gatling) — each with a distinct color identity, body build, and combat role, so classes read as
  visually distinct at a glance rather than reskins of the same figure.
- **Archer draw mechanic** — the bow now visibly charges before firing instead of snapping to a
  static pose; slower arrows but real damage behind a completed draw, because the old instant-fire
  archer didn't read as an archer at all.
- **Expanding spiral map** — starts as a tiny 2x2 area (half path, half buildable), and grows ring
  by ring as waves clear. Expansions alternate between extending the path as a connected spiral
  loop and adding pure buildable space, so the map both winds outward visually and gives you room
  to build, rather than regenerating into a disconnected new shape each time.
- **Barricade** — a non-attacking, path-placeable obstacle. Freezes the first enemy that touches it
  (and anything queued behind it, spaced so they never overlap) — HP only drops from actual hits,
  rate-limited to 1 point per 2 seconds, because a passive timer didn't feel like a "health" stat.
- **Breakaway enemies** — Fire and Ice types (and a small chance for any enemy) can leave the path
  entirely to attack a tower directly, inflicting burn or a slow debuff on it. Gives towers actual
  stakes beyond just DPS math.
- **Troll enemy** — big bounty, walks backward toward the entrance instead of forward, and can
  swing at a nearby tower to drop debris that costs gold to clear.
- **Hero item system** — every tower starts with free class gear; better gear (Iron/Gold/Masterwork)
  is bought per-class from the Shop, plus global passives that apply to every tower owned. A tower
  with all 4 slots filled awakens as a Hero with a permanent stat bonus.
- **Infinite waves** — procedurally scaled difficulty continues past wave 15, since this is meant
  to support long hero-building sessions rather than end at a fixed wave count.
- **Settings menu** — Video (graphics quality), Audio (mute), Game (18+ gore toggle, save/load),
  About (in-app README viewer/downloader).
- **Save / Load** — full game state serializes to a downloadable `.txt` file with a random seed
  header; restorable on this device or any other. Save files are stamped with the game version.
- Numerous balance passes (Swordsman attack speed up, Archer attack speed down, melee swing arc
  widened so it reliably hits everything within its stated range) and bug fixes (an upgrade-cost
  method name colliding with a same-named tier data field, which silently broke every tower upgrade
  past the first one; a Barricade HP display bug caused by a generic regen system applying to a
  tower type it shouldn't have; map generation that could leave zero buildable tiles in a small
  starting region).
